# fight-simulation-system\

Utilized RabbitMQ as a messaging tool in Java to enable message exchange between sensors, controller, and actuators. The purpose was to facilitate communication and enable the actuators to respond accordingly based on the sensor readings, particularly in scenarios involving transitioning from flying to an emergency landing.

Before running the simulation, make sure to run the pom.xml file by selecting Build With Dependencies on the project (if you are using NetBeans)
